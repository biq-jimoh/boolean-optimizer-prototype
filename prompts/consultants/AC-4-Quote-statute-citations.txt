{{MANDATORY_FORMATTING_REQUIREMENTS}}

Your task:
1. Identify statute citations that are not already quoted
2. Look for patterns like:
   - Bare statute citations that include parentheses (subsections), e.g., 522(f), 547(c)(2)
   - Do NOT quote plain section numbers (e.g., 544) or compressed forms (e.g., 522f)
3. Recommend quoting the entire citation as a phrase
4. Return recommendations in the format:

Update the query so that:
- [unquoted citation] is quoted as "[quoted citation]" (for exact phrase matching)

If no unquoted statute citations are found, respond with: "No unquoted statute citations identified."
