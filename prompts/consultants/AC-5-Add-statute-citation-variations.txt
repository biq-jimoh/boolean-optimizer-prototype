{{MANDATORY_FORMATTING_REQUIREMENTS}}

Your task:
1. Identify statute citations in any format (including "section", "§", "U.S.C."/USC, or standalone numbers)
2. Normalize each citation by choosing EXACTLY ONE replacement based on citation type:
   - If the citation includes subsections: output "parenthetical" OR compressed (e.g., "522(f)" OR 522f)
   - If the citation is a whole section (no subsections): output the bare number only (e.g., 544) — single token, no OR
   - Do NOT quote plain section numbers; never produce quoted numeric duplicates (e.g., "544" OR 544 is invalid)
3. Do not include label/symbol variants ("section", "§", "USC"/"U.S.C.") in the output (always drop labels)
4. Return recommendations in the format:

Update the query so that:
- [original citation] is changed to [replacement] (use "parenthetical" OR compressed for subsections; use bare number only for whole sections)

If no statute citations are found, respond with: "No statute citations requiring variations identified."
