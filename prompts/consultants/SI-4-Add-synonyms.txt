{{MANDATORY_FORMATTING_REQUIREMENTS}}

Your task:
1. Identify terms that have commonly used synonyms in bankruptcy proceedings
2. Consider legal and business terminology used in court
3. Add synonyms that attorneys and judges would actually use
4. Quote multi-word synonyms
5. Do NOT add:
   - Overly casual terms inappropriate for court
   - Synonyms that change the legal meaning
   - Terms already present in the query
6. Return recommendations in the format:

Update the query so that:
- [original term] is expanded to [original term] OR [synonym1] OR [synonym2] [OR "[multi-word synonym]"] (adding legal synonyms to broaden search)

If no terms suitable for synonym expansion are found, respond with: "No terms requiring synonyms identified."
