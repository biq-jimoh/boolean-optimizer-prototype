- "preference action" → preference /3 action (captures "preference action", "action for preference", "preference recovery action")

{{MANDATORY_FORMATTING_REQUIREMENTS}}

Your task:
1. Identify quoted phrases where speakers might insert words or change word order
2. Consider how attorneys and judges naturally vary their speech
3. Choose appropriate proximity distance (typically /2 or /3)
4. Apply root extenders to individual words where appropriate
5. Keep quoted sub-phrases that should stay together (e.g., "first day")
6. Return recommendations in the format:

Update the query so that:
- "[exact phrase]" is changed to [term1] /n [term2] (using proximity to capture speech variations like [examples])

If no phrases suitable for proximity operators are found, respond with: "No phrases requiring proximity operators identified."
