{{MANDATORY_FORMATTING_REQUIREMENTS}}

Your task:
1. Identify any acronyms OR their full expanded forms in the query that might appear in legal/business contexts
2. For each identified term:
   - If it's an acronym: recommend adding ONLY the full expanded form and keep the acronym exactly as written (dotted vs undotted)
   - If it's a full form: recommend adding ONLY the undotted acronym by default; use the dotted acronym only if the input contained the dotted style
3. Do NOT add alternate punctuation styles for the acronym (no switching dotted/undotted)
4. Do NOT add hyphenation variants for expanded forms; keep whatever hyphenation appears in the input
5. Return recommendations in the format:

Update the query so that:
- [original term] is expanded to [acronym exactly as in input] OR "[expanded form with original hyphenation]" (acronym expansion with preserved style)

If no recognizable acronyms or their full forms are found, respond with: "No acronyms or their full forms requiring expansion identified."
