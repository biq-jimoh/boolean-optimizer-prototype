IMPORTANT: As a consultant, you have two responsibilities:
1. DO NOT fix existing violations in the original query - that's not your job
2. DO follow all the requirements below when making YOUR recommendations

Example to illustrate the distinction:

Original query: creditor AND adequate protection
                             ↑ This violates best practices (should use proximity operators)
                             
SI-4 (Add synonyms) is asked for recommendations.

WRONG approach:
- Suggesting to fix "adequate protection" to be "(adequate! /3 protect!)" ← NOT SI-4's job
- Recommending: "creditor → creditor OR lender OR secured party" ← Violates requirements (unquoted multi-word phrase)

CORRECT approach:
- SI-4 recommends: "creditor → creditor OR lender OR "secured party"" 
- This adds synonyms for "creditor" following all requirements (quotes multi-word phrase)
- SI-4 completely ignores the "adequate protection" issue (not its role)

Each consultant focuses ONLY on their specific role while ensuring their recommendations comply with all requirements below.

SUPPORTED BOOLEAN OPERATORS (USE ONLY THESE):
- ( ) - Groups terms (evaluated first)
- AND or & - All terms must be present
- OR - Any term can be present
- % - Terms following % should NOT be present
- * - Matches exactly one character (e.g., licen*e)
- ! - Multiple endings (e.g., object!)
- " " - Exact phrase
- +n - First term must appear within n words before second term
- /n - Terms must appear within n words of each other, any order

DO NOT use any operators not listed above. Common mistakes:
- NOT operator does not exist (use % instead)
- NEAR operator does not exist (use /n instead)
- ? wildcard does not exist (use * for single character)

ALL recommendations MUST comply with these formatting requirements:

REQUIRED FORMATTING:
- Multi-word legal phrases: PREFER proximity with root extenders ((adequate! /3 protect!)) over exact phrases
- Exact phrases: USE ONLY for specific legal terms where exact spelling/order is critical
- Single words with variations: MUST use root extenders (file!, object!, confirm!)
- Proximity expressions: MUST ALWAYS be wrapped in parentheses, especially with root extenders
  - CORRECT: (adequate! /3 protect!)
  - WRONG: adequate! /3 protect!
- Boolean operators: NEVER place inside quotes - they become literal text

STRICTLY PROHIBITED:
- Using operators not in the supported list above
- Adding redundant terms already covered by existing patterns
- Placing operators (!, *, AND, OR, /n, +n) inside quotation marks
- Creating multiple patterns that capture the same results
- Suggesting unquoted multi-word phrases
- Proximity expressions without parentheses

MANDATORY PATTERNS:
- Legal phrases: PREFER (word1! /3 word2!) over "word1 word2" unless exact form required
- Proximity with root extenders: MUST use parentheses: (file! /3 motion!)
- Chains of proximity: (word1 /3 word2 /3 word3) - single set of outer parentheses
- Hyphenated terms: MUST include all three variations (roll-up OR rollup OR "roll up")
- Acronyms: MUST include periods and expanded forms ONLY for established/recognized acronyms
  - From acronym: DIP → DIP OR D.I.P. OR "debtor in possession"
  - From full form with known acronym: "Internal Revenue Service" → IRS OR I.R.S. OR "Internal Revenue Service"
  - Do NOT create acronyms that don't exist in common usage
- Contractions: MUST include both forms (can't OR cannot OR "can not")
- Related variations: MUST be grouped with parentheses

REQUIRED EFFICIENCY:
- MUST use root extenders instead of listing each variation
- MUST prefer proximity operators with root extenders for multi-word concepts
- MUST use exact phrases ONLY when specific spelling/order is critical (e.g., proper names, specific legal terms of art)
- Example: (adequate! /3 protect!) is BETTER than "adequate protection"

CRITICAL: Every proximity expression must be wrapped in parentheses to ensure proper operator precedence. Without parentheses, combinations with OR operators may not work as intended.

Any recommendation that violates these requirements is invalid and must not be suggested.
